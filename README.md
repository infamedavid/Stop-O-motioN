# 🏃‍♀️ Stop-O-motion for Blender

**Turn your fluid and boring animation into a stop motion-style animation.**

Stop-O-motion is an addon for Blender that lets you give your animations that handmade, irregular feel typical of frame-by-frame stop motion. Perfect for anyone looking to break free from the perfectly interpolated flow of traditional 3D and get closer to that more human, imperfect rhythm.

## ✨ Stop Motion Aesthetic

Stop motion animation isn't smooth. It has rhythm, it has jumps — it has that handmade charm. This addon captures that vibe with features that let you:

* **Quantize keyframes**: force keyframes to land on fixed intervals (every 2, every 3 frames... whatever you like).
* **Constant interpolation**: so there’s no blending between poses — just clean, abrupt jumps like it should be.
* **Fill spaces**: to help you complete intermediate poses while maintaining the frame-by-frame logic.
* **Stepped modifier**: a non-destructive way to apply that jumpy effect to your animation curves, with options to fine-tune the result.

All designed to help your animation breathe that handmade spirit — without the hassle.

## 🎮 How to use it?

Once installed, open the **Dope Sheet**, press **N** to open the side panel, and you’ll find a new tab called **Stop Motion**.

From there, you can:

* **Select keyframes**: select some or all. The addon works only on selected keyframes.
* Choose a quantization mode: **on twos** (every 2 frames), **on threes**, etc.
* Apply different operations: quantize, fill spaces, convert to constant interpolation, add or remove the Stepped modifier, and more.
* Adjust the Stepped modifier's parameters directly from the UI: frame range, blend in/out, influence… all without touching the graph editor.
